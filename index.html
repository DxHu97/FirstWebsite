      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p> I love web development because I can create anything I want. If there is something that I would like to make a webpage for, I can do it with barely any restrictions. I love working with others because it allows me to do projects bigger that would normally take me years to do in much less time. There are also mistakes that I make that are hard for me to see sometimes, such as spelling errors.</p>
      <!-- seperate <p> to create 2 different paragraphs for about me section-->
      <p>Hobbies that I have include going to the gym and reading books. There's nothing better than working out in the morning and spending the rest of the day coding. </p>
